## A Vampire Program

This is a simple program to demonstrate the "if-elif" conditional statement.

It initializes with a name with the "if " statement and opens the "elif" condition with an  age selector.

If the age is less than "12", the assigned name is printed. If it is more than "2000", then we have a 

vampire in our hands!
